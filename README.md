# Placement Cell Portal
In this repo I have created a website for placement cell of my clg so that its easy to manage the data of students and company

Languages used in this project are:
     HTML   CSS   JavaScript       Frontend
     NodeJs       ExpressJs        Server (connects frontend with the database)
     MySQL                         Database
     
You need to install the dependencies for Server :
              In the project folder open Terminal and give the following commands
                         1)    npm init -y;
                         2)    install express;
After installing the dependencies you project should work on localhost:3000 
               To check if its working properly :
                     Open terminal in the project folder and give th command  ' node Server.js '
Also to connect to your database you need to enter you username and password in the server code as per the need
